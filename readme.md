# **Beatbox Evolution - An abandoned AS3 based, Flixel powered beatbox generator**

**Introduction!**

This beatbox generator was created for the Ludum Dare 24 competition. It features randomly generated beatbox tunes and a super simplistic and ugly drawn frontend. Nothing more than a virtual lava lamp that creates beatbox tunes yet.

It includes a library called Flixel which can be found here: https://github.com/AdamAtomic/flixel.
